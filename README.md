# RandomH
Opens a Random Hentai at Hanime.tv
This runs only on Mac

You need to have Google Chrome installed

To use it you just need to run the script followed by the number of videos you want to open (if you don't indicate a number, it will open just one)

Example:

```./RandH``` to open one

```./RandH 5``` to open 5
